# Qualitative Analysis & Evaluation

This directory contains scripts for qualitative evaluation and comparative analysis of the multi-modal embeddings generated by the extraction pipeline. It focuses on understanding the "semantic fingerprints" of each modality through clustering, archetype mapping, and quantitative metrics.

## 📂 Contents

### 1. `clustering.py` - Archetype Mapping
This script performs unsupervised clustering on the 1,000 most popular movies to visualize how different modalities group content.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses PCA (95% variance) followed by t-SNE (Cosine metric).
- **Visualization**: Generates scatter plots highlighting specific "Archetype" movies (e.g., *Star Wars* for Sci-Fi, *The Graduate* for Drama) to see if content with similar semantics clusters together across modalities.
- **Output**: Saves t-SNE plots as `archetype_tsne_{modality}.png`.

### 2. `radarplot_values.py` - Modality Fingerprinting
Calculates metrics used to build radar charts that describe the "behavior" of each modality.
- **Metrics Calculated**:
    - **Narrative Precision**: Distinctiveness based on narrative genome tags (Plot, Dialogue).
    - **Stylistic Variance**: Consensus/distinctiveness based on stylistic tags (Cinematography, Atmosphere).
    - **Spatial Distinguishability**: Cluster quality measured via Silhouette Score.
    - **Genre Alignment**: Similarity between embedding clusters and MovieLens ground-truth genres using Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI).
- **Output**: Prints a normalized comparison table of these metrics.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

These scripts require the **MovieLens 20M** dataset files in the project root or specified data directory:
- `movies.csv`
- `ratings.csv`
- `genome-scores.csv` (specifically for `radarplot_values.py`)

Additionally, you must have already run the extraction scripts in `src/` to populate the embedding folders (`1_text`, `2_image`, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Run

Navigate to this directory (or run from root with proper pathing) and execute with a Python environment containing `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

```bash
# To generate t-SNE archetype plots
python qualitative/clustering.py

# To compute radar plot metrics
python qualitative/radarplot_values.py
```
