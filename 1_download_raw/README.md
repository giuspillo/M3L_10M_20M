### Download raw data

In this folder, we release mappings we used to download raw data files for movie posters and movie trailers. Movie plots are already provided in the same folder. In addition, for each modality, we provide the scripts we used to collect such data.

To provide a comprhensive pipeline, we also provide a tutorial `tutorial_data_collection.ipynb` in which we show how to:
- download original datasets
- use the provided mappings to query IMDB and collect plot overview (textual data), movie poster URLs, and movie trailer URLs
- download the movie posters and movie trailers starting from the URLs
